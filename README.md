# About the Project
Dogs worldwide experience various health issues, including allergies, diarrhea, immune disorders, and more. We have envisioned creating an application to address these illnesses globally. Through this app, owners can easily find the appropriate treatment for their dogs with just a click. Our approach involves collaboration with veterinarians and experts to ensure the efficacy of the prebiotics we offer, aligning with the specific needs of each dog. Additionally, the application will incorporate features such as symptom tracking and medication reminders for enhanced user experience.

# Milestones
In this section we summarize each milestone and link to a more detail document of artifacts for each.

## Milestone 1
In this milestone, we are formalizing our project idea by creating our project charter and conducting a SWOT analysis. We also create out high-level budget and time estimates.

## SWOT Analysis


### Strengths:
1. Expertise in knowledge management: The organization possesses specialized knowledge and expertise in developing knowledge management tools specifically tailored for non-profit organizations like the Women's Issues Network of Belize. This expertise gives them a competitive edge in understanding the unique needs and challenges faced by non-profits in managing knowledge effectively.

2. Niche market focus: The organization's focus on providing knowledge management tools exclusively for non-profit organizations, particularly those dealing with women's issues, allows them to target a specific and underserved market. This specialization can help them build a strong reputation and establish themselves as a trusted resource in the field.

3. Strategic partnerships: Collaborations with other non-profit organizations, academic institutions, or industry experts can strengthen the organization's capabilities and broaden their network. These partnerships can facilitate knowledge sharing, research collaborations, and access to additional resources.

### Weaknesses:
1. Limited resources: As a non-profit organization, limited financial and human resources can pose a challenge in terms of developing and maintaining effective knowledge management tools. This constraint may impact their ability to innovate and keep up with technological advancements.

2. Lack of awareness: The organization may face challenges in raising awareness about the importance and benefits of knowledge management tools among non-profit organizations. Limited marketing resources and outreach efforts could hinder their ability to reach their target audience effectively.

### Opportunities:
1. Growing demand for knowledge management: As non-profit organizations recognize the value of efficient knowledge management, there is an increasing demand for specialized tools and solutions. The organization can capitalize on this trend by offering tailored knowledge management tools that address the specific needs of non-profits.

2. Collaboration potential: The non-profit sector often emphasizes collaboration and knowledge sharing. By fostering partnerships and collaborations with other non-profit organizations, the organization can expand its reach, exchange best practices, and enhance its offerings based on shared expertise.

### Threats:
1. Competition from commercial vendors: The organization may face competition from commercial vendors offering general knowledge management tools. These vendors may have larger budgets, extensive resources, and established brand recognition, making it challenging to differentiate and compete effectively.

2. Rapidly evolving technology: The fast-paced nature of technology can be a threat, as it requires continuous adaptation and investment to keep up with emerging trends and maintain compatibility with evolving systems. Failure to keep pace with technology advancements may render the organization's tools obsolete or less effective over time.
