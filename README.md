# About the Project
Dogs worldwide experience various health issues, including allergies, diarrhea, immune disorders, and more. We have envisioned creating an application to address these illnesses globally. Through this app, owners can easily find the appropriate treatment for their dogs with just a click. Our approach involves collaboration with veterinarians and experts to ensure the efficacy of the prebiotics we offer, aligning with the specific needs of each dog. Additionally, the application will incorporate features such as symptom tracking and medication reminders for enhanced user experience.

# Milestones
In this section we summarize each milestone and link to a more detail document of artifacts for each.

## Milestone 1
In this milestone, we are formalizing our project idea by creating our project charter and conducting a SWOT analysis. We also create out high-level budget and time estimates.

5. Innovative Technology: Pet-Med Inc boasts a high-quality, interactive website and user-friendly application, enhancing customer experience and accessibility.

2. Dependency on Suppliers: Reliance on suppliers for raw materials and manufacturing processes poses a risk of supply chain disruptions and quality control issues.
3. Regulatory Compliance Burden: Compliance with federal and state regulations concerning pet pharmaceuticals requires continuous monitoring and adherence, adding complexity and potential costs to operations.
4. Resource Constraints: As a sole proprietorship, Pet-Med Inc may face limitations in resources, personnel, and scalability, impacting its ability to expand and compete effectively in the market.
5. Limited Brand Recognition: Building brand awareness and establishing credibility in the pet pharmaceutical industry may be challenging, particularly against larger, well-established competitors.

### Opportunities:
1. Market Growth: The growing trend towards pet health and wellness presents opportunities for Pet-Med Inc to capitalize on increasing demand for specialized probiotic products among pet owners.

2. Expansion into New Markets: Exploring new distribution channels, geographic markets, or product lines can help Pet-Med Inc expand its reach and tap into untapped customer segments.
3. Collaborations and Partnerships: Forming strategic partnerships with veterinarians, pet clinics, or other pet care providers can enhance brand credibility and facilitate product distribution.

3. Supply Chain Disruptions: Disruptions in the supply chain, such as ingredient shortages, logistics delays, or manufacturing issues, could disrupt production and affect product availability.
4. Regulatory Changes: Changes in regulations or compliance requirements for pet pharmaceuticals may necessitate costly adjustments to Pet-Med Inc's operations and product offerings.
5. Negative Publicity or Product Recalls: Any incidents of product quality issues, safety concerns, or negative publicity could damage Pet-Med Inc's reputation and erode customer trust, leading to decreased sales and brand loyalty.
