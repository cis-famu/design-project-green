# About the Project
Dogs worldwide experience various health issues, including allergies, diarrhea, immune disorders, and more. We have envisioned creating an application to address these illnesses globally. Through this app, owners can easily find the appropriate treatment for their dogs with just a click. Our approach involves collaboration with veterinarians and experts to ensure the efficacy of the prebiotics we offer, aligning with the specific needs of each dog. Additionally, the application will incorporate features such as symptom tracking and medication reminders for enhanced user experience.

# Milestones
In this section we summarize each milestone and link to a more detail document of artifacts for each.

## Milestone 1
In this milestone, we are formalizing our project idea by creating our project charter and conducting a SWOT analysis. We also create out high-level budget and time estimates.
